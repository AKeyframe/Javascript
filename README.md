# Javascipt "Theory"

## Objects
Objects in javascript are like hashmaps and hashtables in other programming languages. 

Example of Ojbects:
- Arrays
- Objects 
- Function
- RegEx
- Date

## Const and Objects

We can change variabls and values within objects even if they are constant

When innitalizing an object as a const we can change the variables or data within the object without running into errors. This is because the object itself, when initialized, is refering to a pointer we created in the memory. This pointer lets the computer know where the other variables or data is but the actual value is still remaing constant.
